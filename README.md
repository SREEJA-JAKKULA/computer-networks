The way in which data is transmitted from one device to another device is known as transmission mode.The transmission mode is also known as the communication mode.
Each communication channel has a direction associated with it, and transmission media provide the direction.
The Transmission mode is divided into three categories ; simplex,half-duplex and full duplex .Data flow in computer networks can be categorized into several types based on the direction of information exchange. Unicast data flow involves one-to-one communication, where data is transmitted from a single source to a single destination. Multicast data flow extends this to one-to-many communication, where data is sent from one source to multiple recipients.
